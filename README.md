# A-Structured-Sparse-Subspace-Learning-Algorithm-for-Anomaly-Detection-in-UAV-Flight-Data
Health status monitoring of flight-critical sensors is crucial to the flight safety of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). While many flight data anomaly detection algorithms have been proposed, most do not consider data source information and cannot identify which data sources contribute most to the anomaly, hindering proper fault mitigation. To address this challenge, a structured sparse subspace learning anomaly detection (SSSLAD) algorithm which reformulates anomaly detection as a structured sparse subspace learning problem is proposed.

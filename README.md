##  SSSLAD: A-Structured-Sparse-Subspace-Learning-Algorithm-for-Anomaly-Detection-in-UAV-Flight-Data
Structured sparse subspace learning anomaly detection (SSSLAD) algorithm is an online anomaly data sources identification method for UAV flight data 

## Abstract
Health status monitoring of flight-critical sensors is crucial to the flight safety of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). While many flight data anomaly detection algorithms have been proposed, most do not consider data source information and cannot identify which data sources contribute most to the anomaly, hindering proper fault mitigation. To address this challenge, a structured sparse subspace learning anomaly detection (SSSLAD) algorithm which reformulates anomaly detection as a structured sparse subspace learning problem is proposed.

## Structured Sparse Subspace learning problem
Comming soon.....

## Result
Comming soon.....

## Code Details
A standalone implementation of the algorithm is available in `SSSLAD.m`.
Demos illustrating SSSLAD for flightdata are provided in:
* `SSSLAD_demo1.m`

We implement SSSLAD with Matlab 2015b and perform all experiments on a laptop computer equipped with an Intel core i7-4710HQ 2.50-GHz CPU and 8 GB of memory.

**The code in Matlab will be released soon.....**
